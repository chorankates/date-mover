starting off as a really basic script: determine files last modification date from one folder, move into subfolders based on last modified date.

DONE:
	- added support to key off of modification/access/creation time
	- added support for recursion through File::Find (if recursion is disabled, glob() will be used -- until we find a simple way to disable recursion in File::Find)
	- added support for custom file masks (specification is a glob, but will be 'converted' to a regex if using recursion)

TODO:
	- support multiple directories
